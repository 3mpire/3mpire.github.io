  <p>Hello! My name is Charles and I am a Web Developer. I currently work for the [University of Washington Bothell](http://uwb.edu) full time. I also do freelance contract work through my company, [Struct Software](http://structsoftware.com), and occasionally work as a teaching assitant in C# and HTML5 certificate programs offered by [UW Professional &amp; Continuing Education](http://pce.uw.edu).</p>
