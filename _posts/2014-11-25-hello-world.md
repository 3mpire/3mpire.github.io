title: Hello, world!

Welcome to [*blog](http://3mpire.github.io), my new online home!

My name is Charles and I am a Web Developer.

### Yet another technology/dev blog?

I love learning new things!

This blog is where I can write about dev and technology in an intentional way. Taking the time to write about something new I learned helps me to internalize knowledge. Over time, this blog will be a collection of info I can use as a resource for future learning. 

If someone else happens upon some of this material through a search engine query, hopefully it will be of some value to them as well. But that's the extent of this blog's mission!

### What's next?

The past year or so I have been pushing myself to expand my comfort zone into new areas. To that end, I have been working on personal projects touching on everything from ASP.NET MVC/Web API, C/C++, fun stuff with Arduino and circuitry, and front-end stuff with JS/CSS and HTML5.

So in short: this blog is picking up in media res, as they say. As these personal projects produce something cool or worthy of a little write-up, I'll be stashing that here.

By day, I work as a Web Developer for [UW Bothell](http://www.uwb.edu). Currently I'm working on a project to move our entire environment into the cloud (Azure). We use a Web CMS called [Kentico](http://www.kentico.com), so either of those subjects are pretty good candidates for content as well.

By night, I split my time between personal projects, freelance contract work through my company [Struct Software](http://structsoftware.com), and working as a Teaching Assistant for C# and HTML5 certificates offered by [UW Professional &amp; Continuing Education](http://pce.uw.edu).

### Check me out!

* Personal projects will end up on [GitHub](http://github.com/3mpire).
* I'm a re-tweeting machine for dev humor and reading list material [@_charleswesley](http://twitter.com/_charleswesley). 
* I tend to use Stack Overflow in read-only mode, but I am fairly active on the [User Experience](http://ux.stackexchange.com/users/19574/charles-wesley) Stack Exchange.
